## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

In the process of creating this card, I gained a good understanding of css grid. After looking at the design for a while I noticed that I could utilize a 3 by 3 grid to place text where I want. Some unexpected things that happend while styleing involed my grid within a grid began overflowing, and my grid cell of width:100% plus added border and padding would also overflow. Setting my grid's overflow property to hidden was a good temporary fix. As for the cell overflow I just avoided using width:100%. Editing the box-sizing might have been alternate way to contain text box overflow, but I didn't have go that route.


### Continued development

I want to continue working with CSS Grid and learn how to use Grid in combination with flexBox to create quality and responsive websites. I'd also want to learn more about box-sizing, it seems to be something potentialy usefull.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://youtu.be/7kVeCqQCxlk) - This video showed me how to break down a design to a grid. It also showed me how to structure and use CSS Grid. Exactly what I needed to take on this project.
